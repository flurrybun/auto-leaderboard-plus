# AutoLeaderboard+

By default, leaderboard stats are only updated when viewing the level's leaderboard. This mod <cy>automatically updates leaderboard stats</c> whenever adding a new best.

This is an <co>improved version</c> of the AutoLeaderboard mod by M336.

## Improvements

AutoLeaderboard simply opens the leaderboard menu offscreen whenever viewing the level page, which has a few drawbacks:

- Causes lag when viewing a level page with a full leaderboard
- Sometimes doesn't properly update leaderboard stats, due to them being cached
- Leaderboard stats are only updating when viewing the level page

<cy>AutoLeaderboard+</c> fixes these issues:

- No more lag
- Always updates leaderboard stats, no matter what
- Leaderboard stats are updated as soon as you get a new best
