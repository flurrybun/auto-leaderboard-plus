# AutoLeaderboard+

This is a [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/) mod made with [Geode](https://geode-sdk.org/). After installing Geode, search for this mod in the in-game mod browser and click install.

By default, leaderboard stats are only updated when viewing the level's leaderboard. This mod automatically updates leaderboard stats whenever adding a new best.

This is an improved version of the AutoLeaderboard mod by M336.

## Improvements

AutoLeaderboard simply opens the leaderboard menu offscreen whenever viewing the level page, which has a few drawbacks:

- Causes lag when viewing a level page with a full leaderboard
- Sometimes doesn't properly update leaderboard stats, due to them being cached
- Leaderboard stats are only updating when viewing the level page

AutoLeaderboard+ fixes these issues:

- No more lag
- Always updates leaderboard stats, no matter what
- Leaderboard stats are updated as soon as you get a new best
